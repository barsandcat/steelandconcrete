- BUG #2:
  Calling wxOgreResources::InitialiseAllResourceGoupes before creating a render-  window create a segfault. The Ogre documentation explains that a render-window
  *must* be created before initialisating resources... Is it possible to fix
  this?

- BUG #3:
  Spotted on GNU/Linux with wxGTK, when atl-tab is pressed, or when the window
  is reduced, the render-window isn't updated and part of it is left unpainted
  (ie black).
